\chapter{Mathematical notation}
\label{chapter:notation}

Throughout the paper we choose to label representations by their dimension,
which we typeset in bold. Fields are labelled by their transformation properties
under the Lorentz group and the SM gauge group $\mathrm{SU}(3)_{c} \otimes
\mathrm{SU}(2)_{L} \otimes \mathrm{U}(1)_{Y}$. All spinors are treated as
two-component objects transforming as either $(\mathbf{2}, \mathbf{1})$
(left-handed) or $(\mathbf{1}, \mathbf{2})$ (right-handed) under the Lorentz
group, written as $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{+} \otimes \mathrm{SU}(2)_{-}$. The
left-handed spinors carry undotted spinor indices $\alpha, \beta, \ldots \in
\{1, 2\}$, while the right-handed spinors carry dotted indices $\dot{\alpha},
\dot{\beta}, \ldots \in \{\dot{1}, \dot{2}\}$. Wherever possible we attempt to
conform to the conventions of Ref.~\cite{Dreiner:2008tw} when working with
spinor fields (see appendix G for the correspondence to four-component notation
and appendix J for SM-fermion nomenclature). For objects carrying a single
spacetime index $V_\mu$ we define
\begin{equation}
  V_{\alpha \dot{\beta}} = \sigma^\mu_{\alpha \dot{\beta}} V_\mu \quad \text{
    and
  } \quad \bar{V}_{\dot{\alpha}\beta } = \bar{\sigma}^\mu_{\dot{\alpha}\beta} V_{\mu}.
\end{equation}
Note that in this notation
\begin{equation}
  \Box = \partial_{\mu} \partial^{\mu} = \tfrac{1}{2}\text{Tr}[\partial \bar{\partial}] = \tfrac{1}{2}\text{Tr}[\bar{\partial} \partial],
\end{equation}
and we will often just use $\Box$ to represent the contraction of two covariant
derivatives $D_{\mu}D^{\mu}$ where this is clear from context. For
field-strength tensors, generically $X_{\mu\nu}$, we work with the irreducible
representations (irreps) $X_{\alpha \beta}$ and
$\bar{X}_{\dot{\alpha} \dot{\beta}}$, where
\begin{equation}
  X_{\{\alpha \beta\}} = 2i [\sigma^{\mu \nu}]^{~\gamma}_\alpha \epsilon_{\gamma \beta} X_{\mu \nu} \quad \text{ and } \quad
  \bar{X}_{\{\dot{\alpha} \dot{\beta}\}} = 2i [\bar{\sigma}^{\mu \nu}]^{\dot{\gamma}}_{~\dot{\beta}} \epsilon_{\dot{\alpha} \dot{\gamma}} X_{\mu \nu},
\end{equation}
or the alternate forms with one raised and one lowered index.

Indices for $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{L}$ (isospin) are taken from the middle of the
Latin alphabet. These are kept lowercase for the fundamental representation for
which $i, j, k, \ldots \in \{1, 2\}$ and the indices of the adjoint are
capitalised $I, J, K, \ldots \in \{1, 2, 3\}$. Colour indices are taken from the
beginning of the Latin alphabet and the same distinction between lowercase and
uppercase letters is made. For both $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$, a
distinction between raised and lowered indices is maintained such that, for
example, $(\psi^i)^\dagger = (\psi^\dagger)_i$ for an isodoublet field $\psi$.
However, we often specialise to the case of only raised, symmetrised indices for
$\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and use a tilde to denote a conjugate field whose
$\mathrm{SU}(2)_{L}$ indices have been raised:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:su2l-conj}
  \tilde{\psi}^{i} \equiv  \epsilon^{i j}\psi^{\dagger}_{j}.
\end{equation}
We adopt this notation from the usual definition of $\tilde{H}$, and note that
throughout the paper we freely interchange between $\tilde{\psi}^{i}$ and
$\psi^{\dagger}_{i}$. For the sake of tidiness, we sometimes use parentheses
$(\cdots)$ to indicate the contraction of suppressed indices. Curly braces are
reserved to indicate symmetrised indices $\{\cdots\}$ and square brackets
enclose antisymmetrised indices $[\cdots]$, but this notation is avoided when
the permutation symmetry between indices is clear. We use $\tau^I$ and
$\lambda^A$ for the Pauli and Gell-Mann matrices, and normalise the non-abelian
vector potentials of the SM such that
\begin{equation}
  (W_{\alpha \dot{\beta}})^i_{\ j} = \frac{1}{2} (\tau^I)^i_{\ j} W^I_{\alpha
    \dot{\beta}} \quad \text{ and } \quad (G_{\alpha \dot{\beta}})^a_{\ b} =
  \frac{1}{2} (\lambda^A)^a_{\ b} G^A_{\alpha \dot{\beta}}.
\end{equation}
Flavour (or family) indices of the SM fermions are represented by the lowercase
Latin letters $\{r, s, t, u, v, w\}$.

For the non-gauge degrees of freedom in the SM we capitalise isospin doublets
($Q$, $L$, $H$), while the left-handed isosinglets are written in lowercase with
a bar featuring as a part of the name of the field ($\bar{u}$, $\bar{d}$,
$\bar{e}$). The representations and hypercharges for the SM field content are
summarised in Table~\ref{tbl:sm}. Our definition of the SM gauge-covariant
derivative is exemplified by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:covdi}
  \bar{D}_{\dot{\alpha}\beta} Q^{\beta a i}_r = \left[ \delta^a_b \delta^i_j (\bar{\partial}_{\dot{\alpha}\beta} + i g_1 Y_Q \bar{B}_{\dot{\alpha} \beta}) + i g_2 \delta^a_b (\bar{W}_{\dot{\alpha} \beta})^i_{\ j} + i g_3 \delta^i_j (\bar{G}_{\dot{\alpha}\beta})^a_{\ b} \right] Q_r^{\beta b j} \ .
\end{equation}
Note that the derivative implicitly carries $\mathrm{SU}(2)_{L}$ and
$\mathrm{SU}(3)_{c}$ indices [explicit on the right-hand side of
Eq.~\eqref{eq:covdi}] which are suppressed on the left-hand side to reduce
clutter. Where appropriate we show these indices explicitly.

We represent the SM quantum numbers of fields as a 3-tuple
$(\mathbf{C}, \mathbf{I}, Y)_{L}$, with $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{I}$ the
dimension of the colour and isospin representations, $Y$ the hypercharge of the
field, and $L$ an (often omitted) label of the Lorentz representation: $S$
(scalar), $F$ (fermion) or $V$ (vector), although sometimes we use the irrep,
\textit{e.g.} $(\mathbf{2}, \mathbf{1})$. We normalise the hypercharge such that
$Q = I_{3} + Y$. Finally, for exotic fields that contribute to dimension-six
operators at tree-level, we try and adopt names consistent with Table 3 of
Ref.~\cite{deBlas:2017xtg}.
