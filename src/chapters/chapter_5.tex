\chapter{Models of neutrino mass and the flavour anomalies}
\label{chapter:neutrino-mass-and-flavour-anomalies}

\section{Introduction}

Taken together, the anomalies studied in the previous chapter paint a picture of
new physics interacting more strongly with the second and third generations of
SM fermions, introducing lepton flavour non-universality and FCNC interactions
at energies not significantly higher than the electroweak scale. Interestingly,
many of these phenomenological motifs arise naturally in radiative models of
neutrino mass, hinting towards the attractive possibility of a common
explanation for both phenomena. Previous work has also considered radiative
neutrino mass models whose particle content addresses $R_{K}$~\cite{Pas:2015hca,
  Cheung:2016fjo, Cheung:2017efc, Cheung:2016frv, Popov:2016fzr},
$R_{D^{(*)}}$~\cite{Deppisch:2016qqd, Popov:2016fzr} and
$(g-2)_\mu$~\cite{Babu:2010vp, Cheung:2016fjo, Cheung:2017efc, Cheung:2016frv,
  Popov:2016fzr}. In Refs.~\cite{Pas:2015hca, Deppisch:2016qqd} the flavour
anomalies are explained through two light scalar or vector leptoquarks whose
couplings to the SM Higgs doublet and fermions prohibit a consistent assignment
of lepton number to the leptoquarks such that the symmetry is respected. Thus
$\mathrm{U}(1)_L$ is explicitly broken by two units and the neutrinos gain mass
at the one-loop level~\cite{AristizabalSierra:2007nf}, apart from the imposition
of any additional symmetries\footnote{Mass generation in Ref.~\cite{Babu:2010vp}
  occurs at the two-loop level because the Yukawa couplings of one of the
  leptoquarks to the left-chiral fermions is turned off.}. A general feature of
such models is that large amounts of fine-tuning are required to suppress the
neutrino mass to the required scale with at least one set of leptoquark--fermion
couplings sizeable enough to explain the anomalies.
