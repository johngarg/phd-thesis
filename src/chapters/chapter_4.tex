\chapter{The $S_{1}$ leptoquark as an explanation of the flavour anomalies}
\label{chapter:the-one-lq}

  \textit{This chapter is based on the publication `Reconsidering the One
    Leptoquark scenario: flavour anomalies and neutrino mass,' written in
    collaboration with Yi Cai, Michael A. Schmidt, and Raymond R.
    Volkas~\cite{Cai:2017wry}. We study the potential of the $S_{1}$ leptoquark
    to explain the flavour anomalies and the anomalous magnetic moment of the

\section{Introduction}

A common origin for $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and the anomalous $b\rightarrow s$ data is
suggested naturally if the former is explained by the effects of the operator
$(c^{\dagger} \bar{\sigma}_\mu b)(\tau^{\dagger} \bar{\sigma}^\mu \nu)$, related in its
general structure by $\mathrm{SU}(2)_L$ invariance to the aforementioned
four-fermion effective operator accounting for the $b \rightarrow s$ anomalies.
A number of models exploring this idea have been suggested in the
literature~\cite{Alonso:2015sja, Bauer:2015knc, Becirevic:2016oho,
  Becirevic:2016yqi, Boucenna:2016wpr, Boucenna:2016qad, Calibbi:2015kma,
  Crivellin:2017zlb, Deppisch:2016qqd, Deshpand:2016cpw, Fajfer:2015ycq,
  Feruglio:2016gvd, Feruglio:2017rjo, Megias:2017ove, Popov:2016fzr} (along
with many others addressing one or the other anomaly,
\textit{e.g.}~\cite{Becirevic:2015asa, Becirevic:2017jtw, Buras:2013qja,
  Freytsis:2015qca, Gauld:2013qba, Glashow:2014iga, Gripaios:2014tna,
  Hiller:2014ula, Hiller:2014yaa, Mahmoudi:2014mja, Megias:2016bde, Pas:2015hca,
  Sahoo:2015fla, Sahoo:2015qha, Sakaki:2013bfa, Sierra:2015fma,
  Varzielas:2015iva, deBoer:2015boa}) and among these minimal explanations the
Bauer--Neubert (BN) model~\cite{Bauer:2015knc} is one of notable simplicity and
explanatory power: a \TeV-scale scalar leptoquark protagonist mediating
$\bar{B}\rightarrow D^{(*)}\tau \bar{\nu}$ at tree-level and the
$b \rightarrow s$ decays through one-loop box diagrams. The leptoquark
transforms under the SM gauge group like a right-handed down-type quark and its
pattern of couplings to SM fermions can also reconcile the measured and
predicted values of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, another enduring
tension.

Taken together, these measurements paint a picture of new physics interacting
more strongly with the second and third generations of SM fermions, introducing
lepton flavour non-universality and FCNC interactions at energies not
significantly higher than the electroweak scale. Interestingly, many of these
phenomenological motifs arise naturally in radiative models of neutrino mass,
hinting towards the attractive possibility of a common explanation for both
phenomena. Previous work has also considered radiative neutrino mass models
whose particle content addresses $R_{K}$~\cite{Pas:2015hca, Cheung:2016fjo,
  Cheung:2017efc, Cheung:2016frv, Popov:2016fzr},
$R_{D^{(*)}}$~\cite{Deppisch:2016qqd, Popov:2016fzr} and
$(g-2)_\mu$~\cite{Babu:2010vp, Cheung:2016fjo, Cheung:2017efc, Cheung:2016frv,
  Popov:2016fzr}. In Refs.~\cite{Pas:2015hca, Deppisch:2016qqd} the flavour
anomalies are explained through two light scalar or vector leptoquarks whose
couplings to the SM Higgs doublet and fermions prohibit a consistent assignment
of lepton number to the leptoquarks such that the symmetry is respected. Thus
$\mathrm{U}(1)_L$ is explicitly broken by two units and the neutrinos gain mass
at the one-loop level~\cite{AristizabalSierra:2007nf}, apart from the imposition
of any additional symmetries\footnote{Mass generation in Ref.~\cite{Babu:2010vp}
  occurs at the two-loop level because the Yukawa couplings of one of the
  leptoquarks to the left-chiral fermions is turned off.}. A general feature of
such models is that large amounts of fine-tuning are required to suppress the
neutrino mass to the required scale with at least one set of leptoquark--fermion
couplings sizeable enough to explain the anomalies.

% Our aim in this work is twofold: (i) to study the scalar leptoquark model in the
% context of some previously unconsidered constraints and comment more definitely
% on its viability as an explanation of both $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $R_{K^{(*)}}$; and
% (ii) to build on previous work by considering a two-loop neutrino mass model
% (first presented in Ref.~\cite{Angel:2013hla}) whose particle content includes
% the TeV-scale scalar leptoquark present in the BN scenario. In doing so we hope
% to establish the explanatory power of this simple extension of the SM,
% emphasizing the simplicity with which it can be embedded into a radiative model
% of Majorana neutrino mass. We find that the two-loop scheme heavily alleviates
% the fine-tuning present in the one-loop models, and we expect this result to be
% general for all two-loop topologies.
