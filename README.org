* Chapter 1: Introduction
- [ ] Mathematical notation? Should this be appendix?
- [ ] The SM?
- [ ] Operator mixing and running of couplings?
- [ ] Effective operators, redundancies, bases, integration
- [ ] Radiative mass generation
- [ ] Neutrino oscillations, description, experimental situation
- [ ] Hints of LFU violation, description, theory, experimental situation
- [ ] Leptoquarks, quantum numbers, properties?

* Chapter 2: Model building from effective operators

* Chapter 3: Radiative neutrino mass

* Chapter 4: Reconsidering the BN scenario

* Chapter 5: Non-minimal scenario

* Chapter 6: Quirk project (Appendix?)
- [X] Get paper in
- [X] Fix all cases of Ref, =\textsc= and italic Latin phrases

* References
- [ ] Citations for ATLAS and CMS conf notes look better on CERN document server rather than inspire. Replace these citations and fix up innards with =siunitx= and other math symbols

* Questions for Ray
- [ ] For quirk paper, how do I deal with the fact that the excess has gone
  away? Do I rewrite the tenses and remove phrases like /recently/?
- [ ] Should Rob's paper be an appendix?
- [ ] Is part 1 (on neutrino-mass model builing) and part 2 (on connection to
  the flavour anomalies) a good idea?
- [ ] What do I do with the introductions to the papers?
- [ ] Does it make sense, for example, to move much of the discussion of integrating fields out into the general introduction?
- [ ] Should I be updating plots in older papers?
