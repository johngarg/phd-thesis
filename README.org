- [X] Get paper in
- [X] Fix all cases of Ref, =\textsc= and italic Latin phrases
- [ ] Introduce as a parenthetical piece of work

* References
- [ ] Citations for ATLAS and CMS conf notes look better on CERN document server rather than inspire. Replace these citations and fix up innards with =siunitx= and other math symbols

* Questions for Ray
- [X] For quirk paper, how do I deal with the fact that the excess has gone away? Do I rewrite the tenses and remove phrases like /recently/?
- [X] Should Rob's paper be an appendix?
- [X] Is part 1 (on neutrino-mass model builing) and part 2 (on connection to the flavour anomalies) a good idea?
- [X] What do I do with the introductions to the papers?
- [ ] Does it make sense, for example, to move much of the discussion of integrating fields out into the general introduction?
- [X] Should I be updating plots in older papers?
