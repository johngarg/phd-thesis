* Chapter 6: Quirk project
- [X] Get paper in
- [X] Fix all cases of Ref, =\textsc= and italic Latin phrases
- [ ] Move out of appendix
- [ ] Redo scans with new nufit results?
- [ ] Introduce as a parenthetical piece of work

* References
- [ ] Citations for ATLAS and CMS conf notes look better on CERN document server rather than inspire. Replace these citations and fix up innards with =siunitx= and other math symbols

* Questions for Ray
- [X] Citations: Do I need to cite work that has come out more recently than when we published the paper?
  - Cite all work before thesis
- [X] Four component notation in LQ work
  - As convenient we will use four or two component
- [X] Pure vector operator solution viable now for S1 + S3 model
  - Add a footnote saying "At the time the work was published"
